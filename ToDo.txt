To do:

1) What tests do you want to graph? (WRITE THEM ALL OUT HERE)
    a) Can you grab this data from your local server and from outside servers?
    b) look at: aggregation, average, and statistics attributes of each test

2) Grab the JSON objects with Exploratory software
    a) if you can, try and graph them with python as well

3) write up the rest of the overview (your story with perfsonar)

4) write up the rest of the documentation for Dr. Z

5) submit draft to Dr. Z


---- 
Tests I want to gather:
- Querying Throughput
- Querying Delay/One-way Delay
- Querying Packet Loss
- Querying Packet Traces
- Querying Subinterval Data

Start with these, see what you get back and try to graph it!
