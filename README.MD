## Welcome to my PerfSONAR Project!
Here is a video explaining my program: https://youtu.be/PLyXcgRJn0Q

---- 
**Tests I want to gather:**
- Querying Throughput
- Querying Delay/One-way Delay
- Querying Packet Loss
- Querying Packet Traces
- Querying Subinterval Data

Start with these, see what you get back and try to graph it!


**Published Graphs:**
Throughput:

**Navigating to the Code:**
 To view the final version of the code, you need to navigate to __Python-API-for-Perfsonar/My Api Scripts/Final Scripts/__ 
 (Final Drafts only serves to show the process I went through to create this project and is not production code)
