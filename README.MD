## Welcome to my PerfSONAR Project!
Here is a video explaining my program: https://youtu.be/PLyXcgRJn0Q

Note: 
- For the program itself, go to: ./My Api Scripts/REMOTE - All_in_one_PerfSONAR_Query_V4.py
- To see my development process and program layout, go to: ./My Api Scripts/Documentation
- To see older versions of my program and example output files, go to: ./My Api Scripts/Examples & Previous Drafts

---- 
**Tests I want to gather:**
- Querying Throughput
- Querying Delay/One-way Delay
- Querying Packet Loss
- Querying Packet Traces
- Querying Subinterval Data

Start with these, see what you get back and try to graph it!


**Published Graphs:**
